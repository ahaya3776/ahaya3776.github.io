## Short Biography

I am a PhD Student at the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/taln/labs/lastus">Large Scale Text Understanding Systems Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.upf.edu/en/web/enginyeria/home">Department of Engineering</a> at <a href="https://upf.edu">Universitat Pompeu Fabra</a> (UPF) and currently supervised by Prof. Horacio Saggion. My research focus is **Natural Language Proccesing**, mainly **Text Simplification** and **Question Answering**.

Previously, I obtained Master in Engineering at the <a href="https://nlp.naist.jp/">Natural Language Processing Lab</a> at <a href="http://www.naist.jp/">Nara Institute of Science and Technology</a> (NAIST), supervised by Prof. Taro Watanabe. Also, I received Master in Education at the <a href="https://www.p.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~sieps/en/">Department of School Improvement and Policy Studies</a> at <a href="https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html">The University of Tokyo</a>, supervised by Prof. Yusuke Murakami.
